# probe

A Rust contract for Thruput's RV32 runtime. Start in
[src/implementation.rs](src/implementation.rs) and
[tests/common/mod.rs](tests/common/mod.rs).

## Setup

Install the Thruput CLI and Rust with rustup. Cargo uses the toolchain in
`rust-toolchain.toml` and fetches dependencies from crates.io. Native tests
download the test executor on supported platforms. See the
[getting started guide](https://docs.thruput.network/start/getting-started/)
for installation.

## Test and build

```sh
cargo test
thruput build
thruput test
```

`cargo test` runs the shared behavior checks with the native executor.
`thruput test` builds the RV32 artifact and runs the same checks through
`tests/test_rv32.rs`. Add behavior checks in `tests/common/mod.rs` and call them
from both test entry points. Native success does not establish guest execution.

The default lowered artifact is `target/thruput/probe.rv32a`.
Use the reported path if build output is configured elsewhere. The adjacent
`.spec.json` describes its public interface and declared events.
Building and testing locally does not deploy to a network.

For node-backed RPC tests, run `thruput test --integration`. This requires a
compatible local runtime; see `tests/integration.rs` and `thruput test --help`.

## Project layout

- `src/implementation.rs`: contract state, methods, errors, and events.
- `src/lib.rs`: mock registration and public exports.
- `src/main.rs`: RV32 entrypoint wrapper.
- `Cargo.toml` and `.cargo/`: native/guest features and build configuration.
- `thruput.toml`: project network profiles and build settings.

Keep the generated build configuration and dependency pins unless your change
requires an update. Comments in the manifest explain the feature contracts.
