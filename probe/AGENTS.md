# probe agent guide

Scaffolded with Thruput 0.42.0, template `minimal`.
Start with [README.md](README.md), the manifests, and nearby tests. Use the
project's resolved SDK and toolchain; change pins only when the task requires it.

## Where to work

- `src/implementation.rs`: contract state, methods, errors, and declared events.
- `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs`: crate setup and the RV32 entrypoint wrapper.
- `tests/common/mod.rs`: behavior checks shared by native and RV32 tests.
- `tests/test.rs`: native executor setup.
- `tests/test_rv32.rs`: compiled guest setup.
- `tests/integration.rs`: RPC tests against a node.

## Validate

Run `cargo test` and `thruput test` for contract changes. The latter builds and
executes the guest artifact, by default
`target/thruput/probe.rv32a`; use the reported path if configured
elsewhere. Follow README for setup and other checks. Report native tests, guest
builds, and guest execution separately.

Check the existing manifest and tests before changing features, entrypoints,
or build configuration. Use resolved SDK source for API and storage semantics.

If local source and tests do not answer a question, additional guidance is
optional: start with `thruput skill --help` or `thruput docs --help`. Install
or load only what the task needs. Check the command's `--help` when uncertain.
